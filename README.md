# Battleships

Battleships was a WPF application that I developed through a single window to learn and understand how WPF works. Whilst I did not follow the best practices for developing a WPF app (such as using OOP), it is functional, and users can interact well with the window. If I were to revisit the development, I would utilise OOP and separate the code into different classes and have a significantly more readable solution.
